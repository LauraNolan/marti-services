This is a collection of scripts that developers have contributed which assist in
the administration and use of CRITs.

Many scripts are designed to perform bulk tasks which normally take a long time
to run and are not suitable for executing through a web interface. Others allow
you to perform database tasks which are normally not safe to allow users to run
but might be necessary for administrators or "power users".
