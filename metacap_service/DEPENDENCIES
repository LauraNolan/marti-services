MetaCap has several dependencies outside of those required for CRITs to run.

- Chopshop >= v4.0
- tcpdump
- tshark (part of wireshark)

Chopshop is necessary for running the Metacap service.
tcpdump is used for running the PCAP through tcpdump and displaying the output
in the UI.
tshark is used for generating a PDML representation of the PCAP which allows us
to provide a "wireshark-like" lazy-browsing interface in the UI.
