The MetaCap service allows you to use the Chopshop MetaCap module against a PCAP
in CRITs. It generated a summary of the PCAP, and then a summary of each flow
found in the PCAP. Each flow comes with statistics, source and destination
information, as well as a "flow browser".

The source and destination can automatically be added to the Indicators
collection. The "flow browser" is a quick visual representation of the packets
in the flow. By color and size you can scroll through very quick and determine
the direction, size, and entropy of each packet in the flow.

MetaCap allows you to carve each flow as a new PCAP which is automatically
related back to the parent PCAP. Each flow also comes with a BPF Filter for use
in other applications or the MetaCap TCPDump tab (described below).

Along with the MetaCap service comes a couple tabs to assist with browsing the
contents of the PCAP.

The MetaCap Viewer allows you to generate PDML using tshark and then browse the
PCAP using a wireshark-like interface.

The MetaCap TCPDump tab allows you to run the PCAP through tcpdump (with some
basic configuration options) and view the results directly through the
interface. This tab also allows you to carve the results of this tcpdump command
to a new PCAP.
