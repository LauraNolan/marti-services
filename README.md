crits_services
==============

This repo contains services for CRITs that allow you to extend its
functionality. Information on how to use, install, and leverage these services
can be found in the main CRITs repository:

https://www.github.com/crits/crits

Each service comes with its own README, LICENSE and DEPENDENCIES file. If you
choose to leverage a service, make sure you read the DEPENDENCIES file to
determine what youâ€™ll need to install to use it. The README will be a good guide
to determine what a service does, and in some cases how to set it up and use it.
