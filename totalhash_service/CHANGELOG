Version 0.0.1
-------------
Initial version of PEhash service

It computes PEHash that looks very similar to sha1 output, and is good for clustering PE files.

For all the details please see http://totalhash.com/pehash-source-code/. The code came from http://totalhash.com/download/pehash.py , all I did was wraping it up for CRITs.

It requires bitstring(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitstring) and pefile.
