The Data Miner service works against Samples and Raw Data. It will parse out the
contents of the top-level object in an attempt to find potential Domains, IPs,
and Email addresses.

When working against Raw Data, it will use the contents of the "data" field. If
running against a Sample, it will use the output of "strings" against the
filedata in GridFS.

The list it returns is compared against the contents in the database. If the
Domain, IP, or Email Address already exist at the time the service is run, it
will be logged and a link will be provided to that top-level object. You can
also add the value as a new top-level object or edit the value prior to adding
if you wish.
