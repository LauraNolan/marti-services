The Chopshop service adds the ability to process a PCAP with Chopshop modules.
Currently the service only supports http_extractor and dns_extractor.

It also comes with a carver feature which will allow you to carve HTTP
Requests/Responses, SMTP, and Raw data. It also allows you to specify the
Content-Types you wish to limit to (if any). Any content carved will be added to
CRITs and automatically related back to the PCAP.
