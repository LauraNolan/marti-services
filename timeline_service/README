The Timeline service works for any top-level object. It parses the object and
generates a timeline of things that happened to that object. It is an easy way
to see what things happened on which days in chronological order such as:

- Adding the content to CRITs
- Adding bucket list items
- Adding relationships
- Adding objects
- Adding comments
- Running services
- etc.
